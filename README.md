# Library-Management-System

A robust Library Management System that was developed using the Oracle database and coded in Java. We used JDBC API to connect and execute queries with the database.

The System provides information on availability of books, helps in hassle-free issue/return of books by providing individual logins for all members and librarians. And, based on member-type (faculty/student), imposes different rules for issue of books.

- Librarian's portal has extra features enabled likeâ€”adding/removing new members, issuing books, ordering new books, calculating late fees etc.
- The member's portal allows users to look at their past issues, return-dates for currently issued books, and information regarding their membership.
